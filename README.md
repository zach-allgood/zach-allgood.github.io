# Personal Site for Zach Allgood
This site was created in GitHub to publish myself to the world. Here I will share personal projects, blog posts, and anything I deem important to my career.

## About the Site
I made this site using HTML, CSS, LESS, JavaScript, jQuery, Grunt, FontAwesome, and CSSMin. It took me about a week of programming in my free time.

## The Process
To start everything off, I built the HTML and the CSS one section at a time. I started out on the navigation and the first section and worked my way down until I reached the footer. After that, I created the JavaScript file and, again, started at the top of the page and worked my way down. The JavaScript included the animations, click commands, and changing the page dynamically. I worked on styles while also working with the JavaScript to make sure the invisible objects matched the site when they became visible. After that, I "translated" all of the CSS into a LESS file to make it a little more readable and to practice LESS. Finally, I used CSSMin to minimize the CSS.

## The Future
In the future I plan on starting a blog on the site regarding web development and software engineering as a whole. I also plan on adding a section to showcase my portfolio once I get a good amount of projects to add to it.
