## Personal Site for Zach Allgood
This site was created in GitHub to publish myself to the world. Here I will share personal projects, blog posts, and anything I deem important to my career.

## Creation
My personal site at http://zach-allgood.github.io is currently getting created. I'm working on building this site independently without any templates or people to help. Please be patient as I work on finishing the site along with my work in my career and school.
