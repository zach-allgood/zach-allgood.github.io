# Personal Site for Zach Allgood
This site was created in GitHub to publish myself to the world. Here I will share personal projects, blog posts, and anything I deem important to my career.

## About
I created this site as somewhat of an online portfolio. Its purpose is to help the visitor understand what I do and don't currently understand. If you have any questions feel free to contact me using the information at the bottom of the website.
